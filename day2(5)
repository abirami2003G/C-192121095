5.  Find errors, if any, in the following c++ statements.
(a) long Boat x.;
(b) char *cp = vp;	
(c)	int  code=three;	 
(d)	int *p=new;	
(e)	int const *p=total
(g)	coast int  array_size;
(h)         int & nurnber = 100;
(i) float p=2345;
(j) int else=234;
(k) char a=’welcome’;



ANSWERS:

(a) There are two errors in the statement:

The data type and the variable name are in the wrong order. It should be "long x;" instead of "long Boat x;"
There should not be a period at the end of the statement. The corrected statement is: "long x;"
(b) There is an error in this statement:
The data type of the pointer 'vp' is not specified, so it cannot be assigned to a char pointer 'cp'. The corrected statement depends on the data type of 'vp'.

(c) There is an error in this statement:
The variable 'three' is not defined. It should be defined before it can be assigned to the 'code' variable.

(d) There is an error in this statement:
The 'new' operator requires a data type. It should be something like "int *p = new int;" to allocate dynamic memory for an integer.

(e) There is no error in this statement.

(g) There is an error in this statement:
The correct syntax should be "const int array_size;" to declare a constant integer variable.

(h) There is an error in this statement:
A reference variable cannot be initialized with a constant value. It should be initialized with a variable, like "int number = 100; int& ref = number;"

(i) There is no error in this statement.

(j) There is an error in this statement:
'else' is a reserved keyword in C++, and cannot be used as a variable name. The corrected statement should have a different variable name.

(k) There is an error in this statement:
A char variable can only hold one character. The corrected statement should be: "char a[] = 'welcome';" to declare a character array.
